## Readme

- The **D&N&Time** file is the numerical experiment of Sect. 3.2 The ADSB-GLQ approach. It prepares the data among the distance-size ratio (D), the number of discretized tesseroids (N) and the CPU time.
- The **tesseroid_vs_spherical_shell** file is the numerical experiments of Sect. 3.3 The distance-size ratio values for the GC functionals. 
- The **TopograhicEffects** file contains the codes performed in Sect. 4.
